                  FARMERS WITH JUST A CLICK.</span
                ><br />
                This project came up after I went for a tech conference in Benue
                State Nigeria. There in Benue, I discovered that agricultural
                products was at low-cost, perishable goods being rotten and
                wasting away due to low in demand within the state.<br />
                It was reported across local media in 2019 that Nigeria lost $15
                billion on tomatoe alone. Persishable goods in this state has
                been from farm to waste bin due to low in demand.<br />
                Constrast to this, there are other parts of Nigeria like in
                Lagos for example where agricultural products are substantially
                costly due to high demand in the state.<br />
                Now, to solve this problem, edfreight will link customers in
                area of high demands direct to verified farmers in our platform.
                Edfreight will in the meantime process transactions bewteen
                customers and farmers and even deliver goods direct to your
                doorstep.<br />As you navigate through the site, you'll notice,
                as a good front-end engineer, I took time to consider both the
                UI/UX for easier navigation and experience.

                  VENDORS</span
                ><br />I'am from a place where there are numerious food vendors
                with 99.9% of these vendors running their daily business
                offline. A place where you must step out of your house, office
                etc just to get a taste of that your favourite food.<br />With
                this project, you'll only be a click away from buying your
                favourite food from the best vendors in town. <br />With the
                introduction of vendor's star rating by customers in the
                platform, new users would be able to pick the best vendors<br />As
                always, I'm a front-end developer who builds to make the life of
                people around me confortable taking UI/UX into consideration.
